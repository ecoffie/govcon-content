# FormSpark Auto-Reply: Simple Solution

## What You're Seeing vs What We Need

**What you see in Settings:**
- Email notifications → These are for YOU (the form owner)
- Email threading → Also for your notifications

**What we need:**
- Auto-reply email → Sent TO the person who submits the form

## The Reality

FormSpark's free/basic plan might **not include auto-reply emails to submitters**. Many form services reserve this feature for paid plans or require integrations.

## Two Options

### Option 1: Accept Current Setup ✅ (Recommended)

**Your form already works perfectly:**
- ✅ User submits email → Gets PDF instantly
- ✅ You collect emails in FormSpark
- ✅ No delays, no email issues

**The email is optional** - users get immediate access anyway!

### Option 2: Add Email via Integration

If you really want email confirmations:

**Use Zapier/Make.com (Free tiers available):**
1. Connect FormSpark webhook
2. When new submission → Send email
3. Include download link from `downloadUrl` field

**OR we can add email sending directly in the form code:**
- After FormSpark submission
- Send email via your email service (SendGrid, Resend, etc.)
- Include the download link

## What Should We Do?

**Option A:** Keep it as-is (works great, PDF downloads instantly)  
**Option B:** Add Zapier/Make.com automation for emails  
**Option C:** Build email sending into the form code  

Which do you prefer? The current setup works well - users get immediate access to the PDF!
